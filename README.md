Boni Garcia. Software Engineer/Researcher
=========================================

I love Software Engineering, and so I have a PhD in Information and Communications Technology from <a href="http://www.upm.es/">UniversidadPolitécnica de Madrid</a> (Spain). My main interests are Java, Web Engineering, Open Source, Software Testing and Multimedia.

Currently I am working as a Software Engineer/Researcher at <a href="http://www.urjc.es/">Universidad Rey Juan Carlos</a> (Spain). We are developing <a href="http://www.kurento.org/">Kurento</a>, which is an open source platform devoted to simplify the development of multimedia applications.
